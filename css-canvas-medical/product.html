            &ldquo;Whitch of my uncontolled diabetic patients haven't had a test in the past 3 months? Which of my patients are on potentially unsafe levels of opioids according to the most recent guidelines? That doesn't seem like a lot to ask and those are tremendously important questions.

We're a small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a group of coders to catch everything.
